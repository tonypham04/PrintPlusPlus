# PrintPlusPlus
The intent behind this project was just a fun way to learn more about the Python programming language and see the output from playing with different python functions/features in a custom made GUI as oppose to the console window.

## Latest Changes (Sunday July 10, 2022)
Clicking on the newly added "Export" button allows you to export the content in the text area as a .txt file.
## service.py
The service.py module is meant to be used to contain any desired logic. The return value of the *run* function is what is seen in the Text widget when the "Run" button is clicked.
